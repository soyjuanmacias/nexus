# Nexus (code challenge)

Our objetive is to create an address book.

![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1523379/50910291-ca33ff80-142d-11e9-8b17-97c9faf993cf.png)
<small>This is an example of the objective</small>

## Prologue

In this exercise, app is based on: React + styled-components + React-Router.
If you are not familiar with them you can check the documentation in the
following links:

- React https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
- styled-components https://www.styled-components.com/docs
- React-Router https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start

Around these libraries, we've created a few components and basic structure for
the project. Here we have some highlights of the structure of the project.

- `/components` Contains basic components we are using in the project. Here are
  some files you do not need to worry about: `Theme`, `AddressBook`, `Layout`
  and `Router`.

  There is a component called `Icon`, this component use Material Icons to
  display different symbols. You can find the complete list of icons in:
  https://material.io/tools/icons/

- `/services` Contains the only service we are going to use along the app. You
  do not need to understand the code, it exposes a basic api (`create`,
  `delete`, `read`, `update`) that allow you to handle contacts of the address
  book.

  <small>Tip: This service includes a random delay in each call</small>

- `/test` This folder contains an example of a test you can make for the
  components.

## Run

First at all, clone the repo using the button at the top. Or if you prefer, you
can fork the project.

Then, you need to install all the packages `npm install`. If you want to
start, you can run the application with `npm start`. You can pass the tests by
typing `npm test`.

## Exercise

### Detail view

After run the application, you can see a list of contacts. If you click in any
of them, you'll see a new screen pending of content. You need to create this
screen in order to complete this first step of the test. At least, you'll need
to display 4 elements of the contact.

You can find the component is used for this screen under folder
`/components/ContactDetail`.

The information provided in each contact is (example):

```json

  "gender": "male",
  "name": { "title": "mr", "first": "samuel", "last": "leclercq" },

#### Optional

- Tests for your components
- Create animations for transitions, etc.
- Loader or similar in asynchronous tasks.
- Whatever you want to add :)
- Feel free to refactor whatever you want.

### Search

We need an improvement in our list, we want to be able to filter the list. You
can modify `contacts` service in any way. Remember: You can find the service
under `/services/contacts.js`.

<small>This is an example of the objective</small>

#### Optional

- Headers for any letter. (This includes sort of the contacts).
- Letters index (Right side)

### Add or edit contact (optional)
